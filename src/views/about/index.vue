          <p class="">
            <Strong>CITY OF LIGHTS (COL)</Strong> is a pioneering youth church
            operating under the Young Adults and Youth Affairs (YAYA) division
            of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. City of Lights is a
            community focused on bringing youths and young adults into the Light
            of Christ so they can shine their God-given light to the world.

            "You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be
            hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
            Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in
            the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that
            they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." -
            Matthew 5:14-16

          <hr />
          <p class="">
            <Strong>CITY OF LIGHTS (COL)</Strong> is primarily based in
            Greenwich, CT, but our reach extends to youths and young adults
            across Connecticut. Our target demographic encompasses high school
            and college students, non-students, and young working professionals,
            among others. The mission, inspired by God, is to provide youths and
            young adults an avenue to truly know and commune with Jesus Christ,
            express their God-given gifts, and grow alongside their brothers and
            sisters in Christ.
